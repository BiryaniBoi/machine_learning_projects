# There is a file in the folder names corresponding to
# historical data on your name. It includes for each year from 1800
# to now, how many babies in the United States were given your name as
# their name. The year is not in the file if your name had less than
# 5 babies in the US for that year. Each line of the file
# is formatted like: year num_babies (with a space in the middle)

# if you want to check out the name rankings, go to
# https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/index.html

# replace with your name!
my_name = ""

# let's load the data into a dictionary. Then, answer some
# questions.


# Hint: For some of these, you night want a for loop from 
#		1800 to 2024 (inclusive). you can give a for loop a 
# 		stop and a start with range, i.e. range(2,5) is 2, 3, 4
# Remember, the dictionary may not contain every year from 1880,
# since it doesn't include years with < 5 babies.

# What is the first year your name had more than 5 babies?

# How many years did your name have at least 5 babies?

# Which year did your name have the most?

# How many babies were in that year?

# Which year(s) did your name NOT make the top 1000?

# For the years your name had at least 5 babies, what is the
# average number of babies per year?
